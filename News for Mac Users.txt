Mac Users:

A user-friendly interface to the texture shading algorithm is now available.
Natural Graphics has produced a program called Terrain Texture Shader,
available at:

This program implements the exact same algorithm as the command-line version
available on box.com (as of version 1.3.1), but provides a graphical user
interface, quick preview window, numerous data and image file types, and
several other features - making texture shading much easier to use.
