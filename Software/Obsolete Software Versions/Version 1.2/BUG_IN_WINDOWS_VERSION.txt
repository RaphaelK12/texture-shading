TEMPORARY WORKAROUND FOR BUG IN WINDOWS VERSION
===============================================

For the Windows version of the "texture" program, you will need to include the
file extensions explicitly on the command line. For example, this will NOT work:

    texture 0.5 input output

However, this WILL work:

    texture 0.5 input.flt output.bsq

This problem will be fixed in a future update.
