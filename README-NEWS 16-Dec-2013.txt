Version 1.3.1 is now available!

This version includes some improvements to the texture shading algorithm to
produce better images; speed improvements; and some usability improvements.

The current user guide is still a work in progress, and the sample images
have not yet been updated to reflect the changes in the algorithm.

Check back from time to time for additional improvements to the software and
other items on this site.
